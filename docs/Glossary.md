# Glossary

**crater/impact crater -** a paraboloid structure surrounded by pushed up terrain,, formed from impact events. Crater topography is divided into two sections, the transient crater, making up most of the paraboloid, and crater rim, making up the rest of the paraboloid and all of the pushed up terrain.

**impact event -** an event in which an object collides with a planet, like asteroids

**transient crater -** the inner structure of a crater, being a paraboloid. The transient crater's edge is marked by where the terrain height becomes greater than the pre-crater surface height

**transient radius -** the distance from the crater center to the transient crater's edge

**crater rim -** area of the crater outside of the transient crater to the crater's edge (is the same as the crater rim's edge), starting at the distance from end of the transient crater, and extending out to the edge of the terrain pushed by the crater's impact event (the edge of where the terrain height is still greater than it's pre-crater surface height)

**rim radius -** the distance from a crater's center to the edge of its rim

**pre-crater surface height -** the height of the terrain in a crater from before an impact event

**terrain height -** refers to the height of a single tile, or heights of a group of tiles making up a region
