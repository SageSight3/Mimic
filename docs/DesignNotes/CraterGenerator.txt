	A simplified relationship between crater diameter and impact energy is:
		Kinetic Energy = Diameter^3
	
	Energy can the be used to determine mass (units of height) needing to be added
	For Mimic
		Split asteroids into three categories for velocity: high, medium, low
		Subject to change:
			High = 2
			Medium (average) = 1 (most impacts should come from objects with medium velocity)
			Low = .5

		Process
			Randomly generate crater size
			Use formula to calculate mass to add to map/height needing to be distributed
			0.5*(heightToBeAdded)*velocity^2 = diameter^3

		Math for reference
			Volume of 1 unit of height: 500000cm * 500000cm * 10000cm = 2.50E+15cm^3
	M = 2g/cm^3 * 25000000m^3 = 50,000,000,000kg

Proof
Chicxulub Crater radius = 100km = 20 tiles
		Estimated mass = 1.0E+15kg = 20000units of height
		Estimated Volume = 4.188790E+17 cm^3 = 16755 units of height
				Estimated width = 10km = 2 tiles

	erg is a unit of energy - 1 erg = 1E-7 J
Kinetic Energy = (9.1 * 10^24(200km)^2.59)erg = 8.292950699999998890E+23 J
Kinetic Energy using 1/2M*v^2 = (1.0E+15(20000^2))/2 = 2.0E+23 J
(1.0E+15(20000^2))/2

8.292950699999998890E+23 J = 1/2Mkg((20000m/s)^2)
M = ~ 4.1464753E+15kg
		In same order of magnitude as estimated mass of impactor

	Medium Velocity = 20000m/s = 4 tiles/s

In crater generator algorithm - parameters will take a depth range
	craterRadius = craterDepth * (1 /log(craterDepth)) * 5 + rand() % 2 //note rand is c++ rand, other languages wouldn’t need mod
                                                                        //also exists to add slight variation to craters of similaar depths
                                                                        //is unnecessary

	Based off observations that crater diameters tend to be in the range of 5-10-15?-20? times larger than their depths, trust the process, i did the research before, though i lost it
	
	After radius is found, impactEnergy = (random float between 1 and 10, min value = 1) * 10^17((2*radius in tiles*5km)^2.59)
	To find mass in units of height: impactEnergy/(2*(velocity^2)*50,000,000,000)

//found through the math, as well as some trial and error
To find height needing to be redistributed:
Full formula: ((thread_rng().gen_range(1.0..10.0)) * ((2*radius*5)^2.59)*10) / (2*500*velocityTier)
10^2.59 = 389.045144994
91 * 389.045144994 = 3540.31081945
3540.31081945 * 10 = ~ 35400
//simpliefied equations are mostly accurate
Simplified equation: (35400(radius^2.59))/(2000*velocityTier) with hard constant of 9.1
Simplified equation using rng: (thread_rng().gen_range(1.0..10.0) * 3890 * (radius^2.59))/(2000*velocityTier)

*******also from original note**********

	Note: The numbers do work to get within the target margin, just try not to think about it to much, it’s weird

Impact Crater formation notes
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_crater
		"As a result, about one third of the volume of the transient crater is formed by the ejection of material, and the remaining two thirds is formed by the displacement of material downwards"

Stretch goal: implement crater aging -> modification and collapse

Beyond crater lip? if performance allows:
	within 2 to three radii, deposit 
	
Crater rim radius (assuming from crater center) is 1.3x to 1.9x the radius of the transient crater
	crater rim height:diameter ratio will be 
		.2x diameter for craters where transient crater radius <= 15km,
		.08-.8 for craters where transient crater diameter > 15km

crater radius formula
	//C++
	transient_radius_actual = (crater depth * (rand() % 2) + 3))/5.0
		//from real world observations, transient crater radii relative to depth line up with reality
	transient_radius = round(transient_radius_actual)
	rim_radius = round(transient_radius_actual * (1.3 + (rand() % 0.7)))

Note: crater depth does is for full transient crater depth, crater will not be that deep, as max excavation depth is only around a third of full transient crater depth
	Formula for crater depth should divide it by 3

Have different sub generators for different sizes of crater radius (radius > 9)?
