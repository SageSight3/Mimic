For impact generation
	Earth had estimated -> Note these numbers are just for the LHB (Late Heavy Bombardment)
	unclear if specified diameters are transient crater diamerters or from rim to rim, going off observations in research,
	I believe they're for the transient crater specifically
		~100,000 craters > 20km in diameter
		~3000 craters > 100km in diameter
		~90 craters > 1000km+ in diameter

These estimates, assuming 50,000 years per pass, and setting eon duration to the duration of the LHB (20M-300M years), would give a frequency of 17-250 impacts per pass at 400-6000 passes

	//subject to change
	min crater depth = 3
	max crater depth = 168
	skew = rand() % -166

For Mimic, this estimates ~C*8,786,200 operations from the impact generator using concept algorithm unchangd
C range upper bound estimate: ~20

Estimated upper bound for ops over course of LHB impact generation with unchanged concept algorithm ~180,099,000
